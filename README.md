 The Drum Bombard interface consists of a set of circular drum pads arranged in a grid layout. Each pad is labeled with the name of the corresponding drum sound it produces. You can click on any pad to produce the associated sound. Alternatively, you can use your keyboard to trigger the sounds by pressing the corresponding keys.
